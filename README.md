# personal-loan-for-home-renovation

<p align="justify">We often think that personal loans are credited during times of severe emergency, like, extreme financial crisis, or medical emergencies, which is not always the case. Personal loans come with their own flexibility range. This means that amount credited through a personal loan can be used for various purposes, amongst which home renovation is a primary one. Further, there are various benefits and advantages that come along with this type of loan.

We have provided with reasons as to why one should avail the option of personal loan for house renovation:

<p align="justify">Personal loans are quite easily qualified, as there are various banks and NBFCs in the market that are waiting to transact credit for personal loans. But to avail of this loan one has to pass through the eligibility criteria provided by that particular institution. One can credit a loan based on his/ her expenses which can be related to – home remodeling, repair work, interior designing, furnishing, and more.

<p align="justify">As this is an unsecured loan thus a borrower does not need to think about the security of mortgaged assets. Similarly, SBI Personal Loan is also not dependent on collateral value, thus reducing the process of distress for procuring and risking ancestral assets. This also results in getting the funds in a short period of time. For example, an individual does not have to put his/ her car for a mortgage just to remodel their house.

<p align="justify">It comes along with the Flexi loan facility. This Flexi loan is known for providing flexibility during repayment of credit. Under this facility, one can withdraw and repay funds from the total principal credited, according to one’s needs. Moreover, the interest rate is also charged on the amount of money that has been utilized.

<p align="justify">It lets the borrower choose his/ her tenure according to their financial situation. Banks offer a tenure between 2 – 36 months between which one has to pay off their debt. With the help of this, it is possible to pay off the loan with a lump sum amount within two months, thereby having to pay less interest. While the other option being a slow EMI that maybe continues for 2- 3 years.

<p align="justify">Funds are released quickly under an unsecured loan. As personal loans need no collateral in exchange for credit money unlike a gold loan, thus the process of verifying the asset quality is nullified. This results in a quicker transaction of money. After all the necessary documents are submitted along with the application one has to wait for the approval. Further, money is credited to the specified bank account within 5 minutes to 24 hours of the approval.

<p align="justify">Lastly, another reason for availing of personal loans is that it involves minimum paperwork and documentation while applying in banks or NBFCs. The important documents that one should be prepared with are one’s identity proof, employee ID card, salary slips of the last two months, and last 3 bank statements, preferably from the salary account.
